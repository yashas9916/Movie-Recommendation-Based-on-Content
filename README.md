# Movie Recommendation Based on Content

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation Based on Content project! This project aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations by analyzing the content of movies. Instead of relying on user ratings or preferences, our recommendation system utilizes the features and characteristics of movies to suggest similar ones that may align with the user's tastes.

## Introduction

Traditional movie recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering or user-based preferences. This project takes a different approach by focusing on the content of movies. By analyzing factors such as genre, plot keywords, and other relevant features, the recommendation system aims to provide more accurate and diverse suggestions.

## Features

- Content-based movie recommendation
- Support for multiple features, including genre, keywords, and more
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Scalable architecture for handling large datasets

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/yashas9916/Movie-Recommendation-Based-on-Content.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   !pip install pandas
   !pip inatall numpy
   ```

## Usage

The user interface allows you to input your preferences or select a movie, and the system will generate recommendations based on the content of the chosen movie. You can explore different genres, filter by keywords, and discover new movies that match your interests.

## Data

The project uses a curated dataset of movies, including information such as title, genre, keywords, and other relevant features. The dataset is available in the `data` directory.

## Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm leverages machine learning techniques to analyze movie features and calculate similarity scores. The system continuously learns and improves its recommendations as more users interact with it.
